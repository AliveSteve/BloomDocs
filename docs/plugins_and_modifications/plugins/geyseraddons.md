## How to install the addons

There are 2 different types of Geyser addons.

The first kind of Geyser Addon is installed by uploading it to your plugins folder. Some examples of plugin addons are Bedrock Player Managment and SimpleGeyserVL.

The second kind of Geyser Addon is installed via the experimental [Geyser Addon PR](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/pull/742). An example of an experimental addon is GeyserReversion.

## The list

### Bedrock Player Management
Bedrock Player Management adds a way to give specific permissions to your bedrock players.
This is most useful when using a anticheat that doesn't come with built in Geyser support.

You can download it [**here**](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bedrock-player-managment-for-floodgate-geyser.82278/)

### SimpleGeyserVL
SimpleGeyserVL is a plugin that allows bedrock players to use votifier voting!
Floodgate Prefixes will no longer be a issue with this plugin installed!

You can download it [**here**](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/simplegeyservl.80300/)
