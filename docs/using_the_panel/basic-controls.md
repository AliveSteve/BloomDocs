<h1>Basic Panel Controls</h1>

### Accessing The Panel

You can access your server's main control panel [here](https://mc.bloom.host/). If you have multiple servers, you can choose which you want to modify from the manel page. Or, simply choose the server you want to control from the drop-down box of each page within the panel.

### Live Information
<div class="text--center"><img src={require('../../static/imgs/using_the_panel/basic_controls/2.png').default} alt="console"/></div>

Purple - Your server's IP address and port.<br>
Blue - Your server's ID which is needed when opening a support ticket.<br>
Green - The amount of RAM your server is using. Do not be alarmed if this is maxed out, as many of our servers utilize Aikar's optimized JVM flags.<br>
Orange - The amount of CPU your server is using. The max amount is equivalent to 100% multiplied by the number of logical cores your plan has.<br>
Red - The amount of storage your server is using. If you reach the maximum amount of storage, your server will not boot until space is cleared.

### Game Console & Server Control
Here, you can send any command and see what everyone on your server is doing. When launching a command, remember to remove the `/`. If you still want to use a `/`, consider using [this](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/81157) plugin!

These buttons allow you to start, stop, and restart your server. It is not recommended killing your server as plugins and worlds wonâ€™t save and may become corrupted. Only use it if your server becomes unresponsive.

### Graphs
Lastly, you can see the server's live RAM, CPU and network usage in a form of graphs! As mentioned above, with Aikar's flags, it will show up as if you were using most of this.
