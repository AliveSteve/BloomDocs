With the release of 1.17, the first part of the Caves & Cliffs update quite a few internal changes were made to the game.

With every update it takes a while for softwares such as Spigot and forks of it to update and support all the changes. Unfortunately it's not possible to have a set ETA for 1.17 support but you can keep track of updates on [SpigotMC.org](https://www.spigotmc.org) (Spigot already released their 1.17 version) or on  [PaperMC's GitHub](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper/issues/5785)!

Moving forward the game will use Java's latest release, Java 16. Other softwares such as Paper and other forks have also announced that they will be upping their minimum Java version requirement to 16. **This also means some plugins may require updating to support this change as some plugins aren't compatible with Java 16.** Be sure to check the plugins' Spigot or GitHub pages!

### Precautions
A new version of the game with loads of new content also means potential new exploits and issues.
- Before updating be sure to create and test a backup of your entire server. Downgrading a world without causing corruption is near impossible.
- Moreover, if you aren't utilizing our [completely free and automatic backup feature](../using_the_panel/backups.md), we would highly suggest you set that up before updating.
- Once you update to 1.17 you can't go back to any previous version, unless you reset your worlds or restore a backup that was made when the server was on the previous version.

### Updating The Jar
Once your desired server jar supports 1.17, simply follow these steps to update:
- Make sure that your server is backed up completely.
- [Create full backup](../using_the_panel/backups.md) of your server. (As an additional step, we would suggest testing this backup on a local or a split test server)
- Remove your current server jar through [SFTP](../using_the_panel/sftp.md) or the [File Manager](../using_the_panel/file-manager-controls.md).
- Download the new version of your server software. If you are unsure which one to use, check out our guide on server jars [here](jars.md).
- Upload it using SFTP or the File Manager and make sure to define the full name (such as `paper-1.17-023` in the 'Startup' tab on the panel)

### Changing To Java 16

:::important
If you are unable to change this next setting and you see a message such as "This server's Docker image has been manually set by an administrator and cannot be changed through this UI.", please [open a ticket on the support Discord.](https://discord.com/invite/bloom) and Bloom.host staff will need to change this for you.
:::

1. Firstly you want to go to the [Minecraft server control panel](https://mc.bloom.host/) and select the server that you want to change the Java version of.
2. On the left side, select 'Startup'.
3. Next, find the Java Version tab (usually on the top right of the page) 
4. Select the `quay.io/parkervcp/pterodactyl-images:debian_openjdk-16` option!
5. Start your server back up!
